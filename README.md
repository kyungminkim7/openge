# OpenGE
OpenGE is a cross-platform C++ game engine for Desktop and Android platforms.
This project produces a Conan package that can be imported for use with
Qt or Android Studio projects.

## Build - Linux
This project has been built and tested on Ubuntu 24.04.
The easiest way to build this project is through Docker using the provided Dockerfile.

Dependencies:
- Build: Docker
- Run: Qt 6

Build Steps:
1. Create a workspace directory for Conan projects:
    ```bash
    mkdir workspace
    cd workspace
    ```

2. Clone repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kyungminkim7/openge.git
    ```

3. Create Docker image for building the project:
    ```bash
    docker build -t conan openge
    ```

4. Run Docker container for building projects:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it \
        -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) \
        -e CONAN_HOME=$(pwd)/.conan2 \
        conan
    ```

5. Generate Conan profile:
    ```bash
    conan profile detect
    ```

6. Create Conan package:
    ```bash
    conan create openge --build=missing
    ```

7. The `openge` Conan package can then be used for other Conan projects in
the same workspace.
    - Example `conanfile.txt` recipe template:
        ```
        [requires]
        openge/<VERSION>

        [generators]
        CMakeDeps
        CMakeToolchain

        [layout]
        cmake_layout
        ```
    - Example `CMakeLists.txt` commands:
        ```
        # ...
        find_package(openge CONFIG REQUIRED)
        # ...
        target_link_libraries(<YOUR_TARGET> openge::openge)
        ```

Doxygen documentation can be generated by running
`conan build openge --build=missing` and viewed by
opening `openge/build/Release/html/index.html`

## Build - Android
Requirements:
- Minimum SDK: 31
