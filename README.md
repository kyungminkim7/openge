# OpenGE

OpenGE is a cross-platform C++ game engine for Desktop and Android platforms.
This project produces a Conan package that can be imported for use with
PC or Android Studio projects.

## Build - Linux

This project has been tested on Ubuntu 24.04.
The easiest way to build this project is using the `kyungminkim7/openge` Docker
image or by building your image through the provided `Dockerfile`.

Dependencies:

- Build: Docker

Build Steps:

1. Create a workspace directory for Conan projects:

    ```bash
    mkdir workspace
    cd workspace
    ```

2. Clone repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kyungminkim7/openge.git
    ```

3. Run Docker container for building projects:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it \
        -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) \
        --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
        kyungminkim7/openge
    ```

4. Create Conan package:

    ```bash
    conan create openge --build=missing
    ```

5. The `openge` Conan package can then be used for other Conan projects in
   the same workspace.
    - Example `conanfile.txt` recipe template:

        ```ini
        [requires]
        openge/VERSION

        [generators]
        CMakeDeps
        CMakeToolchain

        [layout]
        cmake_layout
        ```

    - Example `CMakeLists.txt` commands:

        ```cmake
        # ...
        find_package(openge CONFIG REQUIRED)
        # ...
        target_link_libraries(<YOUR_TARGET> openge::openge)
        ```

Doxygen documentation can be generated by running
`conan build openge --build=missing` and viewed by
opening `openge/build/Release/html/index.html`

## Build - Android

Requirements:

- Minimum SDK: 31
